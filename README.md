# Jingil
Jingil is a script that inform you about new posts on sites that you chose .
# Installation
just copy jinset folder somewhere and run setup-jingil.sh , after the first time , for adding or deleting or ... run it again . 
# How does it work
it uses rss to check the new post ,so  may doesn't match with some sites ; and also it works with notify-send and cron job .(dependencies)
(it was my first experince in bash , so it's realy dirty :D )
